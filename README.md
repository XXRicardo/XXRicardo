👋 Hey, I'm [ricardo]  

An undergraduate student at **Huazhong University of Science and Technology** (HUST), majoring in [Cybersecurity]. Diving into the world of tech, I'm exploring areas like **software development**, **network security**. Eager to deepen my skills and contribute to cool projects along the way!  

In my free time, I love tinkering with code, watching tech talks, and getting lost in sci - fi novels. I believe every line of code and every new concept is a step toward understanding how technology shapes our world—like building blocks for a digital future.  


### Skills and Tools  
💻 **Software** — Python, C/C++,
🔍 **Research** — IOT in Cybersecurity 
🛡️ **Security** — Vulnerability Detection、Secure Coding


### Today's Quote  
> "In software, we build not just programs, but bridges between ideas and reality—one line of code at a time."  
> *— Inspired by endless debugging sessions*
